<h2>268. Missing Number</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Easy</h3>
<div>
<p>Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.</p>

<p><b>Example 1: </b></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [3,0,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong>  n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
</pre>

<p><b>Example 2: </b></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [0,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong> n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
</pre>

<p><b>Example 3: </b></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> 8
<strong>Explanation:</strong> n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
</pre>

<p><b>Constraints:</b></p>
<ul> 
   <li>n == nums.length</li>
   <li>1 <= n <= 10⁴</li>
   <li>0 <= nums[i] <= n</li>
   <li>All the numbers of nums are unique.</li>
</ul>
</div>
